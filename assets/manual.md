### Visualization Page
The **Visualization Page** is your starting point for understanding the underlying weather and crop data. It offers 3 visualizations, each in a tab within the page, to help you grasp the patterns and trends in both datasets. Here’s how you can interact with this page:

- **Crop & Weather Data Visualization**:  

  This part visualises how each weather feature correlates with the crop yield, which allows you to uncover relationships between certain weather features to that specific crop.

  **Actions**:

  - Click on different crops to display their yield data and show the correlation heatmap between each weather attribute to the yield.
  - Click on different weather to display the feature's line chart, look for patterns between the trends in both weather and yield lines.
  - Zoom in or out on the graph to examine specific time periods more closely.

- **Crop Data Visualization**:  

  This section presents a visual representation of crop yields based on historical data, which can help you analyze how weather has affected crop growth in previous seasons.

  **Actions**:

  - Click on different crops to compare their yield data against corresponding weather patterns.
  - Zoom in or out on the graph to examine specific time periods more closely.

- **Weather Data Visualization**: 

  The weather data is displayed through graphs showing temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and other important variables over time.  

  **Actions**:
  
  - Hover over the charts to see specific data points.
  - Zoom in or out on the graph to examine specific time periods more closely.

### Prediction Page
The **Prediction** page is designed to predict crop yields based on current or historical weather data. By using advanced machine learning models, this page allows you to estimate the yield for various crops under different weather conditions. Here’s how you can use it:

- **Select a Crop**:  

  For the time being, the only crop used for model training and prediction is rice.

- **Input Weather Data**:  

  You can input specific weather parameters (e.g., temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, etc.) to simulate potential crop yields under hypothetical conditions.  

  **Actions**:
  - Choose specific weather values from the input sliders.
  - Click the **"Predict”** button to calculate the predicted crop yield.

- **View Prediction Results**:  

  After generating a prediction, the app will display the estimated crop yield for the chosen crop based on the weather parameters provided. The result includes:
  
  - A numeric yield estimate from the top 3 performing models.
  - A graphical comparison of predicted yield vs historical averages.

### General Tips & Troubleshooting
- **Accuracy of Predictions**:  
  While the app provides an estimate of crop yield based on weather data, please note that predictions can vary depending on the accuracy and completeness of the data used in the model.
  
- **Data Limitations**:  
  The app uses historical weather and crop data. If the data is outdated or incomplete, the predictions may not be fully accurate.
  
- **Performance Issues**:  
  If the app is running slow, try:
  - Refreshing the page.
  - Reducing the range of data or limiting the number of parameters you're analyzing.

- **Error Messages**:  
  If you encounter any errors, such as a failed prediction or a broken graph, please check your input values. Incorrect or out-of-range data may lead to inaccurate results. You can also contact support for further assistance.
