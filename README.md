A large portion of land is dedicated to farming, and farmers are now seeking ways to boost productivity and maximize returns. 

Studies shown that precipitation and changes in temperature indeed have impacts on crop yield, indicating that **adapting farming practices** to address these climate variations is essential for sustaining agricultural output.

## Problem Statement

**Crop yield predictions** have traditionally depended on farmers' experience and knowledge of their land and crops. However, as weather conditions change and crop diversification increases, there is a growing need for **accurate data** to support decision-making. 

Farmers are seeking more detailed information about new crops and their profitability to **enhance productivity** and financial success. Improved estimates of crop performance in varying environments can lead to better outcomes for farmers.

Moreover, extreme weather events can disrupt crop yields, emphasizing the need for **advanced weather forecasting** in agricultural planning to enhance resilience and support food security in Malaysia.
